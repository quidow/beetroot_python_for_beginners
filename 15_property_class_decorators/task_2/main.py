"""
Implement 2 classes, the first one is the Boss and the second one is the Worker.
Worker has a property 'boss', and its value must be an instance of Boss.
You can reassign this value, but you should check whether the new value is Boss.
Each Boss has a list of his own workers. You should implement a method that allows you to add workers to a Boss.
You're not allowed to add instances of Boss class to workers list directly via access to attribute,
use getters and setters instead!
You can refactor the existing code.

```
id_ - is just a random unique integer

class Boss:

    def __init__(self, id_: int, name: str, company: str):
        self.id = id_
        self.name = name
        self.company = company
        self.workers = []

class Worker:

    def __init__(self, id_: int, name: str, company: str, boss: Boss):
        self.id = id_
        self.name = name
        self.company = company
        self.boss = boss
```

    boss = Boss(1, fake.name(), company)
